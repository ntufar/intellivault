## Quick Reference

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js 20 + TypeScript + Express
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage
- **Search**: Azure AI Search
- **AI/ML**: Azure OpenAI Service
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Microservices Architecture**: Loosely coupled services with clear boundaries
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Asynchronous document processing with queues
- **API-First Design**: RESTful APIs with comprehensive documentation
- **Cloud-Native**: Containerized services on Kubernetes
- **Defense in Depth**: Multi-layered security approach

### Performance Targets
- **Search Response Time**: < 2 seconds for 95% of queries
- **Document Processing**: < 5 minutes for standard documents
- **Concurrent Users**: 1000+ simultaneous users
- **Throughput**: 10,000 documents per hour processing
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability SLA

## Getting Started

1. **For Developers**: Start with [Architecture Overview](./ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md) and [System Design](./SYSTEM-DESIGN.md)
2. **For DevOps**: Focus on [Deployment Architecture](./DEPLOYMENT-ARCHITECTURE.md) and [Monitoring Architecture](./MONITORING-ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. **For Security**: Review [Security Architecture](./SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE.md) and [AKS Deployment Guide](../AKS-DEPLOYMENT.md)
4. **For Product**: Reference [Product Requirements Document](../PRD.md) and [API Architecture](./API-ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Key architectural decisions are documented throughout the architecture documents. Major decisions include:

- **Technology Selection**: Azure-native services for scalability and integration
- **Authentication Strategy**: Azure AD integration with JWT tokens
- **Data Architecture**: Multi-model approach with Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, and AI Search
- **Deployment Strategy**: Kubernetes-based deployment with Helm charts
- **Security Model**: Defense-in-depth with comprehensive audit logging

## Contributing to Documentation

When updating architectural documentation:

1. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure terminology and concepts are consistent across documents
2. **Update Cross-References**: Update related sections in other documents
3. **Version Control**: Update document version and review dates
4. **Review Process**: All architectural changes require team review
5. **Testing**: Validate code examples and configuration snippets

## Document Maintenance

- **Review Cycle**: Quarterly review of all architectural documents
- **Version Control**: Each document maintains version history
- **Ownership**: Architecture team owns all architectural documentation
- **Updates**: Document updates reflect actual implementation changes
