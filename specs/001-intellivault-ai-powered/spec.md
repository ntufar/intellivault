**Feature Branch**: `001-intellivault-ai-powered`  
**Created**: December 19, 2024  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "IntelliVault AI-powered document intelligence platform with semantic search, automated summarization, and knowledge discovery capabilities"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a knowledge worker, I want to upload my organization's documents and search through them using natural language queries, so that I can quickly find relevant information without manually reviewing hundreds of documents.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has uploaded documents to the system, **When** they perform a semantic search query like "contracts with termination clauses", **Then** the system returns relevant documents ranked by relevance with highlighted matching sections
2. **Given** a user has a large document collection, **When** they request a summary of a specific document, **Then** the system generates an accurate abstract highlighting key points and entities
3. **Given** a user is exploring document relationships, **When** they navigate the knowledge graph, **Then** they can discover connections between documents, entities, and concepts
4. **Given** a user asks a question about their document collection, **When** they use the Q&A feature, **Then** the system provides accurate answers with source document references
5. **Given** documents are uploaded to the system, **When** the AI processing completes, **Then** documents are automatically classified and entities are extracted with high accuracy

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user searches for information that doesn't exist in the document collection?
- How does the system handle documents in languages other than English?
- What occurs when a user uploads corrupted or unreadable files?
- How does the system handle very large documents that exceed processing limits?
- What happens when multiple users are searching simultaneously during peak usage?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support uploading documents in multiple formats (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images, audio, video)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide semantic search capabilities that understand natural language queries beyond keyword matching
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate automated summaries of uploaded documents highlighting key points and entities
- **FR-004**: System MUST create and maintain a knowledge graph showing relationships between documents, entities, and concepts
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide an interactive Q&A interface that answers questions about document collections
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically extract entities (people, organizations, locations, dates, monetary values) from documents
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically classify documents by type and topic
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide faceted search allowing filtering by metadata, entities, dates, and document types
- **FR-009**: System MUST support batch upload capabilities with drag-and-drop interface
- **FR-010**: System MUST detect and handle duplicate documents appropriately
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide search analytics tracking popular queries and results
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to save and share common search patterns
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide trend detection across document collections over time
- **FR-014**: System MUST highlight anomalous or unusual documents in collections
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- **FR-016**: System MUST integrate with enterprise identity providers (SSO, SAML, OAuth)
- **FR-017**: System MUST maintain comprehensive audit logs of all user activities
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide automated backup with point-in-time recovery capabilities
- **FR-019**: System MUST support 20+ languages for document processing and search
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide sentiment analysis capabilities for document tone assessment

*Requirements requiring clarification:*
- **FR-021**: System MUST process documents within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific time limits not specified - what is acceptable processing time?]

- **FR-023**: System MUST handle document collections up to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: storage limits not specified - petabyte scale mentioned but specific limits needed]
- **FR-024**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific compliance features not detailed - GDPR, HIPAA, SOX requirements need specification]
- **FR-025**: System MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention policies not specified - how long to keep processed documents?]
