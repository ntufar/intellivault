# Feature Specification: IntelliVault Platform Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-intellivault-intelligent-document`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "IntelliVault - Intelligent Document Intelligence & Knowledge Discovery Platform"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a knowledge worker, I want to upload documents to IntelliVault and use natural language queries to find relevant information quickly, so that I can spend less time searching through documents and more time acting on insights.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has multiple PDF documents
   **When** they upload the documents to IntelliVault
   **Then** the system should process them automatically and make them searchable within 5 minutes

2. **Given** a processed document collection
   **When** a user performs a natural language search query
   **Then** the system should return relevant results within 2 seconds

3. **Given** a document in the system
   **When** a user requests an executive summary
   **Then** the system should generate a concise summary highlighting key points

4. **Given** a knowledge graph of documents
   **When** a user explores relationships between documents
   **Then** the system should display an interactive visualization of connections

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a corrupted or password-protected document is uploaded?
- How does the system handle documents in unsupported languages?
- What happens during system overload (>1000 concurrent users)?
- How are partial or interrupted uploads handled?
- What happens when search queries contain specialized industry jargon?
- How does the system handle region failover for high availability?
- What happens when AI models need to be updated or retrained?
- How are vector embeddings recomputed when AI models are updated?
- What happens during network partitions in the distributed system?
- How does the system handle data replication across regions?
