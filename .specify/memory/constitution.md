# IntelliVault Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security First
All features must prioritize secure handling of sensitive information. Encryption at rest and in transit is mandatory. Access controls and audit logging are required for all sensitive operations.

### II. Modular Architecture
Components must be loosely coupled and independently deployable. Each module must have a single responsibility and clear interfaces. Dependencies between modules must be explicit and documented.

### III. Test-Driven Development
All features require test coverage before implementation. Unit tests, integration tests, and security tests are mandatory. Test scenarios must cover both success and failure cases.

### IV. Documentation Driven
All APIs, configurations, and user interfaces must be documented before implementation. Documentation must be treated as a first-class deliverable and kept in sync with code changes.

### V. Observability
Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing must be implemented for all operations. Error handling must provide meaningful context for debugging. Performance metrics must be collected and monitored.

## Development Process

Our development process emphasizes collaboration, code quality, and continuous improvement:

- Feature branches must be created from the main branch
- Pull requests require peer review and passing CI checks
- Code must follow established style guides and best practices
- Documentation must be updated with code changes
- Breaking changes require migration guides

## Quality Standards

All code contributions must meet these quality standards:

- Static code analysis passes with no critical issues
- Test coverage meets minimum thresholds
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Performance benchmarks are within acceptable ranges
- Security scans show no high-risk vulnerabilities

## Governance

This constitution serves as the foundational document for project governance and development standards. All development activities must align with these principles and standards.

### Amendment Process
1. Propose changes with clear rationale and impact analysis
2. Review period of at least one week for team feedback
3. Two-thirds majority approval required for adoption
4. Version number must be updated according to semantic versioning
5. Update all affected documentation and templates

### Compliance
- All pull requests must verify compliance with these principles
- Regular audits will ensure ongoing adherence
- Violations must be documented and addressed promptly
